# React Native App w/StackNavigator & Context API

>Focus is on react-navigation StackNavigator handling click event to move to the next page when the user selects a item from a 
FlatList Component. We show the FlatList Component, the use of the StackNavigator but instead of passing parameters between pages,
we use the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to update the to level state to show the current item
